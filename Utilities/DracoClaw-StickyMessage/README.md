Have Atlas send a "Sticky Message", a message that is always at the bottom of the channel.

Use the [Embed Builder](https://atlas.bot/tools/embed-builder) to create your message. Paste it after the `// Note`, replacing the default example.

As MessageCreate actions have a 1 minute cooldown for Humans, it is recommended to only use this action in channels with not a lot of activity.

Set the "Message Channel" to the channel you want the Sticky Message to be sent.
